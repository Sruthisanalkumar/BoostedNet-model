# BoostedNet-model
BoostedNet model, combines a 6-layer CNN with an Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) algorithm, to recognize the H. pylori bacterium in gastric histopathological images. This model classifies gastric histopathological images as H. pylori -positive (H(+VE)) or -negative (H(-VE)). Performance evaluation of the BoostedNet model was accomplished by training and validation via publicly accessible gastric histopathological image datasets. A remarkable 99% accuracy in the detection of the H. pylori bacterium in (H\&E)-stained gastric histopathology images was achieved. Besides, the proposed generic BoostedNet model demonstrated consistent performance across datasets stained with Giemsa, highlighting its reliability and robustness. These findings demonstrate that the proffered CNN model, in coalition with the XGBoost algorithm, outperformed the baseline CNN model with a 1%-8% performance boost with different stained datasets.
